## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for data-driven insights. In response, i embarked on a data engineering project to build an analytics platform. Our platform leverages AWS services to enable data acquisition, processing, and analysis.

## Relational Data Model

To organize and manage our data, i  designed a relational data model. This model defines the structure of our database, including tables, primary keys, and relationships.

## Connecting Athena for Data Querying

Amazon Athena is a powerful tool for querying data stored in Amazon S3. We'll show you how to set up Athena, define databases and tables, and execute SQL queries to extract valuable insights from your data.

## Implementing an ETL Job in Python

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is a crucial step in data engineering. We'll demonstrate how to implement an ETL job using Python. This job will extract data from a source, perform transformations, and prepare it for loading into our analytics platform.

## Saving Results to Amazon S3

Once we've processed and transformed our data, we'll need a reliable storage solution. Amazon S3 provides scalable and durable storage. We'll guide you through the process of saving ETL job results to S3.

## Building Tables on Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift is our data warehousing solution. We'll create the necessary tables on Redshift to store our cleaned and transformed data. We'll discuss schema design, primary keys, and distribution keys.

## Copying Data to Amazon Redshift

Finally, we'll demonstrate how to copy data from S3 into Amazon Redshift tables. This step is critical for making our data accessible for analytics and reporting.

## Conclusion

Our COVID-19 analytics platform is now ready for action! We've covered every step of the data engineering process, from designing a relational data model to querying data using Athena, implementing ETL in Python, storing results in S3, building tables on Redshift, and loading data into Redshift. With this platform, you can analyze, visualize, and gain insights from COVID-19 data effectively.
